# ColorMatchingGame
Lua Color Matching Example
## This lua "app" was created with the help of Corona SDK

1. Divide the screen into 10X10 evenly spaced tiles.
2. Generate (total number of tiles / 2) colors to be paired with each tile
3. Create table to store each RGB for the randomply generated colors. 
4. Assigne a random color sequence to the tile and add the tile to the display.
    ** if there are an odd number of (total tiles/2) there will be an extra tile left at the end of the game.
5. This was created as an example for CS 371 UAHuntsville
6. Added Score TitleBar to make this more interesting.

This was for pure fun. My first attempt at lua.
